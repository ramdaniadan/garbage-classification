# Garbage Classification with VGG16

### 🌟 Overview

This project focuses on classifying garbage types into 10 categories using deep learning techniques. Leveraging the pre-trained VGG16 model, it ensures high accuracy with efficient training and validation processes.

### Why It Matters 🌍

Efficient garbage classification plays a crucial role in:
- Reducing environmental waste.
- Facilitating recycling processes.
- Promoting sustainability.
